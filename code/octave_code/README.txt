This code for extracting the PS statistics from segments and
textures requires the code of the Portilla-Simoncelli model to
be available, as well as the code from Freeman et. al. for
generating metamers. A modified version of the main analysis
scripts for this code is found in the auxiliary_PS_functions
directory
